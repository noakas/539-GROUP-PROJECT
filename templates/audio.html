          <h2>About me...</h2>
          <p>I grew up in New York City and studied cultural anthropology and art history at Mount Holyoke College. Material culture classes, museum internships, and two years spent working with a photographer's archive lead to my UMSI application.</p>
          <p>I believe the past is shaped as much by objects we discard as by those we save. Archivists are critical to a dynamic that links culture, memory, and history. They assign artifacts value, make them accessible, and steward them through rapid technological changes. My exposure to this process as a digital image archivist motivates my interest in taking an active role shaping archival practices. As a graduate student at the University of Michiganâ€™s School of Information (UMSI), I hope to deepen my understanding of digital archiving and build skills that will allow me to implement changes to the management of born-digital content.</p>
